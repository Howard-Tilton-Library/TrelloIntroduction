# TrelloIntroduction

A brief introduction to Trello for those interested in learning more about how and when to use it. The material included was developed for a professional development workshop on 8/17/2017 at the Tulane H-TML.

These materials include a Powerpoint and a PDF version of the presentation which explain how Trello can be used to track complicated projects, reoccurring projects, or projects that require the input of multiple contributors using sample boards advertised by Trello as exemplary. The middle of the presentation is a list of the tasks which are central to using Trello: creating projects, teams, lists, and cards. It also includes links to lists of other tools that integrate well with Trello.
